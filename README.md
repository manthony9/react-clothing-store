# react-clothing-store
a simple react based clothing store

A simple clothing store created using React, making use of Redux , Firebase, Stripe and other React functionalities.

The main purpose for this project was learning react basics and complete a project solely based on react. Among tons of other things, I learnt :-

- How to use redux to make a single source of truth to render the app
- Using selectos for better optimization and usability of code. This way the selectors only transfer data that is needed and not the entirety of the state.
- Using reducers to re-render the parts of the state that change and not the entire state

Still working on making changes to the app to make it look a bit better.
