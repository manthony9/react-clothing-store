# Clothing-Store

## a simple react-based clothing store

### :pushpin: What did I learn ?

- How to use redux to make a single source of truth to render the app
- Using selectos for better optimization and usability of code. This way the selectors only transfer data that is needed and not the entirety of the state.
- Using reducers and action modules to faciliate the singles-source of truth concept. Passing actions and props to the reducer. 
- Using firebase-auth for easy authroization
